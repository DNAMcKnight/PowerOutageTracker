# PowerOutageTracker
Join me on my ride figuring out how to use the ESP8266 along with microPython and making a program that tracks power outages in my house. 

## The recent power outages in my country has disrupted my workflow.
This project should help me get a better picture of what time I am able to code for a consistant 4-5 hours. Fingers crossed if we do get 5 straight hours.

What data can I get from this project?

- How many time the power goes out every 24 hours.

- how long each outage lasts in average each day.

- longest outage in 24 hours.

- notify when power is out if you're not home.

- process daily data into another file with outage time and duration.

That's all I will most likely get going for now however I would like to maybe add some machine learning and possibly predict when and how long the power could be gone to better prepare for things. 

That's all I have to say, this isn't a guide for others to follow but mostly a project of my own that I want to finish up so I don't know if I can help others figure out my code but feel free to send me a DM on discord if you'd like to work with me or create your own version of this project.
